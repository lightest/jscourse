How to work with this lesson:
-----------------------------
First look what's inside .html and .css files. Try to understand
which style is for what and how they work. Then go to .js
and look at the notes for each function. First examine the window.onload
function, then bindUIActions(), then slide(), then generateSlides().

Homework:
---------
Extend the functionality of the slider in the way it is possible
to slide to the particular slide, not just backwards or forwards.

For instance I say "slide 23", your slider should be able to jump
to slide 23 invoking slide() function only once (obviously it needs to be rewrited).
