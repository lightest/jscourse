Lesson6:
--------
In this lesson we learned how to create custom data types in JavaScript and finished our chat page.

Topics covered:
- custom datatypes
- function's prototype
- how to simulate private static data
- usage of `translateX` property for alignment
- why it's important to specify viewport in `<meta>`


Homework:
---------
Different devices have different events that are optimal to use in button handlers.
For instance optimum in desktop browsers would be usage of `'click'` event. Whereas on iPhone
it is more efficient to use `'touchstart'` or `'touchend'` events or their combination.
So the homework is to create a parsing function that determines which touch event should used in `.addEventListener()`.
Then rewrite all existing code so it can rely on proper events.
