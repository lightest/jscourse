What is this:
-------------
In this lesson we've created a structure for our app.
It holds few page modules and a simple markup for them.
Navigation between pages is done via client side routing.
See comments on modules in eventsPage.js file and more on routing
approach in app.js.
If you need an http server for this you can use very simple one
provided as node package, see more here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

Homework:
---------
In order to practice modular thinking create a module for router functionality.
There is also a markup for the header of the page. Create functionality
that slides page to the left when user presses menu/hamburger button.
Use principles from lesson1 to make it slide as you need.
