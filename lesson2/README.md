Lesson2:
-------------
In this lesson we've created a structure for our app.
It holds few page modules and a simple markup for them.
Navigation between pages is done via client side routing.
See comments on modules in `eventsPage.js` file and more on routing
approach in `app.js`.
If you need an http server for this you can use very simple one
provided as node package, see more here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

Topics covered:

- what is module pattern
- how to create module which holds logic of the page
- what is client side routing
- how to use regular expressions

Homework:
---------
In order to practice modular thinking create a module for router functionality.
There is also a markup for the header of the page. Create functionality
that slides page to the left when user presses menu/hamburger button.
Use principles from [lesson1](https://github.com/lightest/jscourse/tree/master/lesson1) to make it slide as you need.
