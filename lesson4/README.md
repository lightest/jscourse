Lesson4:
-------
In this lesson we examined how one can create a very simple HTTP server
that works in parallel to main one and accepts requests from any origin.
Topics covered:
- XMLHttpRequest (or AJAX)
- HTTP server basics
- What Access-Controll-Allow-Origin header does


Homework:
---------
Create a bit more functionality for our simple server app.
Let there be at least 3 request one of which responds with
string, one with object, and one which returns whatever was in the request.
Build a page that sends requests of all 3 types.
